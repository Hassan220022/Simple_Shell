# Simple Shell Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Simple Shell project! This repository contains the code and documentation for our implementation of a Unix-like shell. This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum and is designed to challenge our skills in programming, C, engineering thinking, and group collaboration.

## Project Guidelines

Before starting with the code, it is crucial to understand and adhere to the project guidelines outlined by Julien. Please review the [project framework](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/559) and ensure compliance with the specified rules. Integrity and individual understanding are paramount in our learning journey.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, we aim to achieve the following learning objectives:

- Understand the origins of the Unix operating system and its shell.
- Identify key figures in the development of Unix, including the designers of the original Unix OS, the first UNIX shell, and the B programming language.
- Gain knowledge about Ken Thompson and his contributions.
- Grasp the basics of shell operations, including process identifiers (pid and ppid), process creation, and termination.
- Differentiate between functions and system calls.
- Learn how to use the execve system call and manipulate the environment of the current process.
- Understand the role of the PATH variable in finding programs in the shell.
- Implement process suspension and comprehend the concept of "end-of-file" (EOF).

## Resources

To enhance our understanding, we will explore the following resources:

- Unix shell
- Thompson shell
- Ken Thompson's contributions
- [Everything you need to know to start coding your own shell](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/64)

## Requirements

Our project adheres to specific requirements, including:

- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Compilation: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specified options
- Code style: Follow the Betty style; use betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl for checks
- No memory leaks
- README.md file at the root is mandatory
- AUTHORS file listing all contributors
- GitHub: One project repository per group, and both partners should understand all code pushed

## Compilation

Compile our shell using the provided gcc command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```

## Testing

Our shell should work in both interactive and non-interactive modes. Examples are provided in the project guidelines.

## Conclusion

The Simple Shell project is an exciting opportunity to apply our skills and deepen our understanding of key programming concepts. Let's focus on understanding the solution path rather than taking shortcuts. Happy coding!
